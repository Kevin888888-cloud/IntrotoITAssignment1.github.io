<h2>My IT project idea</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="5">Overview:
              <p style="text-align: justify;">My project is a software to help people from different cultural and religion backgrounds integrated better. This software can be run in cloud platform, Windows system, Macintosh system, Android system, Web-based platform, even in virtual machine. This software used machine-learning algorithm to scan user’s personality, cultural background and religion background, and the data that algorithm grab will generate a report file. This report file contains many index and data to match other user’s file, and another index will be generated to make sure whether those two user’s personality, cultural background and religion background are suitable or not. Besides, another neural network algorithm will automatically generate a solution to help two users integrated better.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Motivation:
    My motivation for designing this software is to make people from different cultural and religion backgrounds get along well with each other and live in a peaceful environment. Nowadays, this world still has many violence and discrimination in terms of clash of civilization. According to New Zealand government’s statistical data, the Christchurch mosque shootings caused 51 people died and 49 people got injured. According to Australia Human Rights Commission data, it received 409 complaints under the racial discrimination act in 2016-2017. I want to use my software to deal with those social issues, to make people become more happier and healthier. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Description:
Data mining and big data algorithms:
    My software will collect user’s personal data into our cloud database. My big data algorithm will systematically extract information form on different user’s religions, cultural background, personality background, and then generate the data output. It will use cross-industry standard process for data mining with six stages: Business understanding -> Data understanding -> data preparation -> modeling -> evaluation-> deployment. For my data mining process, my software will follow anomaly detection-> association rule learning->clustering->classification->regression->summarization. </p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Data visualization:
    Results on each user’s personal information will be visualized as a graphic representation of data in their app. They will be use statistical graphics, plots, information graphics to demonstrate each user’s specific personal background information. My software will also use Bar Chart, Histogram, Scatter plot, 3D scatter plot, network analysis, streamgraph, treemap, gantt chart, heat meap, stripe graphic, animated spiral graphic to display user’s items as well</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Artificial Intelligence used in my app:
    My software will use artificial intelligence algorithm on problem solving methodology. It will use knowledge representation tree, it is an ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. It will also contain hierarchical control system with a hierarchical tree to demonstrate the priority of conflict of interest on different religion conflicts. Beside, it will use sub-sumption architecture tree to automatically allocate different solutions on cultural control conflicts and behavior conflicts. Next, it will use machine learning algorithm, unsupervised learning algorithm, deep learning algorithm, natural language processing algorithm, social intelligence algorithm, neural network algorithm, artificial neural network algorithm, deep recurrent neural networks to solve problems from clash of civilizations aspects, conflict of daily behaviors, conflict of world point of view and send of value, inconsistent attitude toward people who have different religion understanding, historical conflicts and war in terms of different faith. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clients feedback:
    Clients feedback are also play a significant role in my project. I will set up a systematical comments system for my clients to help them solve their issues. For example, if one of my client use my software to cultural or religion conflict with others, and my software problem solving methodology cannot solve those issues, my software will automatically collect client’s feedback information. Their feedback information will be into my software’s cloud database and my artificial intelligence robots software will help my clients to find out a better solutions toward the feedback information. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cost of software:
    My software is free for individual users. For organizational users such as government, international organizations, business organizations, non-profit organizations, those targeted clients need to be charge in terms of market sizes and quantity of users. For charitable organizations, we will provide a special encrypted license for them to make sure they are free to use. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Tools and technologies: 
    For Integrated development environment platforms, I will use visual studio enterprise edition, Atoms, Xcode, pycharm on coding. For artificial intelligence and related programming, I will use matlab, maple, deepmind, Nasa open source software to design algorithms.  For allowing my software to be downloaded, I want to apply license for apple store, google play, amazon cloud, Huawei cloud, Tencent cloud, Tencent online shopping center to make sure my app can fit their license. For cloud base center, I want to rent Huawei cloud, Ali-cloud or Tencent cloud to do data storage. For security reason, I want to buy Symmentic or Trend enterprise solutions for cyber security and data protection.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Skills Required 
    I need to know iOS related language to do coding on XCODE system. I need to learn python, Java, C++ on back end level. I need to know how to use Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise edition to do programming on back end level. I need to learn how to use Microsoft Azure, Amazon cloud, Huawei Cloud and other online cloud-based data storage system to save user’s data. I need to learn how to use Github to display some open source code for other partners. The last but not the least, I need to learn social skills to make sure investors, targeted clients, target organizations can accept my ideal and goodwill. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Outcome:
    If this project is successful, I think there will be many venture capital, private equity capital goes into my company. My company will from a small individual company to a limited liability company, and then become a public company. I want my company had better go public in one of those stock exchange to solve financial problems: New York Stock Exchange, London Stock exchange, Hongkong exchange, Shanghai exchange. I hope my app can bring peace and reduce discrimination and the clash of civilization, I hope the positive impact of this app can make the whole world and human race live in prosperity. </p>
